Pepys-import
=============

Pepys-import is a Python library to be used in the parsing and
collation of data to be used in platform-based spatial analysis.

The library provides tools to help work through text data-files, and then
push data measurements (and supporting metadata) to a databases.

PostgreSQL and SQLite databases are currently supported, with SQLite being
the low-friction option favoured for getting started with Pepys-import, or
for project maintainers.
