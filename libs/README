Libraries folder
----------------
As part of the deployment and CI process we download various libraries such as SQLite
and Spatialite. Some of the sites these are downloaded from are flaky, and often give
errors - so we've hosted one of the files here.

At the moment, only one file is hosted in this directory: the spatialite install file for
Windows.
