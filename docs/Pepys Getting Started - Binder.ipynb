In Pepys, these represent real-world objects such as Platforms (a vessel such as a ship or submarine), Sensors (some sort of measurement/sensing device on a Platform) and Datafiles (a file that is being imported into Pepys). All these objects have metadata associated with them. For example, a Platform has a Nationality and a Platform Type, and all objects have a Classification for security purposes.\n",

    "The first question asks you to accept the default name for the datafile - just press Enter for this. You'll then be asked to select a classification for the datafile. Various pre-configured classifications will be listed (these are just examples used during testing). Choose option `4` to set the classification to `Private`. You will then be given all the information about the datafile, to allow you to confirm everything is set correctly - just choose option `1` to confirm and continue.\n",

    "The next set of questions are about the Platform. You should choose to add a new platform (option `2`), and then you'll be asked for details. It doesn't matter what name or details you give it, as this is just an example - but note that some fields are optional. Next is the search for a nationality - again, you'll get a list of the most common nationalities, but can search for others if you want to. For now, just choose `3` for `United Kingdom`. When you're given the list of pre-defined platform types to choose from, choose `2` to add a new platform type and enter `Frigate`, before selecting a classification of `Private` and confirming the addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next stage is entering data about the sensor used to collect the data that we're importing. In this case, we're importing a GPX file, which is a file format used by GPS systems - so the sensor name is pre-filled as `GPS`. So, choose to add a new sensor (option `2`), add a classification and confirm the details are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now finished adding metadata, and the import itself will take place and a progress bar will (very quickly) move up to 100% completed. You will then see a summary of the database status after the import - it should show 5 States, and 1 Platform are now in the database. This matches our expectations from the datafile - it had 5 position reports, and they were all about one platform."
