        will not work for the Measurement tables, as the attributes of the class have different

        Does a full merge, taking all data from the slave_store database and merging it into the master_store
        database. At the end of merging, print some summary tables with merge statistics and lists of
        new objects added.

        Both master_store and data_store can be connected to either Postgres or SQLite databases.

        The overall outline of the merge is that we first merge the reference tables and most of the metadata
        tables, then merge the Synonyms and Datafiles tables, then copy across the relevant entries from the
        measurement tables, before finally filtering and copying the Logs and Changes tables.

        In general, "merging" here means comparing the two databases and dealing with these specific situations:
          a) The exact same entry exists in both databases, with the same GUID.
          This will occur when this entry was exported from the master database to the slave database.
          This is counted as 'already present', and nothing is done to change it.

          b) An entry exists in the slave database which isn't present in the master database
          This will occur when the entry is added to the slave database after the two databases have been
          separated This entry will be added to the master database, and counted as an item 'added'.

          c) An entry exists in the slave database with the same details as in the master database, but with
          a different GUID. The details that are compared to see if the entry is the same are the name field
          for a reference table, the fields defined in a unique constraint for any other table (eg. `name` and
          `host` for Sensors) or all fields if a unique constraint isn't defined. If optional fields are present
           in the slave database that are not present in the entry in the master database, then these are
           copied across. If the privacy value in the slave database  is higher (ie. more secure) than the
           entry in the master database, then the privacy is updated to match the slave value. This entry
           counts as a 'modified' entry, as the GUID in the slave database is modified to match the GUID in
           the master, so that other objects can be copied without failing foreign key integrity checks.
           This does NOT mean that the data for the entry has been modified - this is only the case if the
           `data_changed` field is set to True in the resulting list of ids.

        The measurement tables (States, Contacts etc) aren't merged as such: new entries are just copied
        across. This is done based on the entries in the Datafiles table: we keep track of the IDs of all
        datafile entries that are added to the master from the slave, and then just copy the measurement data
        that has come from those datafiles.

        Logs and Changes are merged at the end, so that we can check each Log entry to see if it refers to
        something that actually exists in the master database, and only copy it if it does.

        The results from the merge_all_* functions consist of:

         - A list of 'added names': a dictionary with keys for each table merged, and values of a list of all
          the new 'names' that have been added (the 'name' is either the name field, if it exists, or the
          'reference' or 'synonym' field if it doesn't.)
         - A list of statistics: a dictionary with keys for each table merged, and values of a dictionary
         with counts of items 'already there', 'modified' and 'added'.
