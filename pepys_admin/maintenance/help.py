## 1 - Merge
When multiple rows from a table are selected, the user is invited
to merge the e rows.  The merge action starts with the user
selecting the target row that that the data is to be merged into.
When merging platforms, the sensors of the platforms to be merged
are moved to the target platform.  If a sensor with that name
already exists then the measurements are moved to the existing
sensor.

## 2 - Split platforms
If the data-type is Platform, and just one row is selected, the
user is able to split that platform into multiple new platform
instances.  The platforms are split according to the datafiles
their measurements are imported from.

## 3 - Edit values
If one or more rows are selected then Edit Values can be used to
edit one  or more fields for those data items.
